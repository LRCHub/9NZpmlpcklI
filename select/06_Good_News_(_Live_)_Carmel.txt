"Good news, good news, Someone dropped a bomb somewhere
Contaminating atmosphere
Blackening the sky." they say, And that's the news I heard today ...
Good news, good news. I hear we've gone and won a war -Saving all our lovely boys, The real war's just begun, The war between the rich and poor.
Good news, good news. Who wrote the bible (it was man), Who stole the apple (it was Eve), You charlatan Vatican blaming it on Eve -Adam stole the apple from the tree
Good news, good news. But good news, I've got some good news: I saw a face, I saw a face -It was five in the morning, with no warning- saw a face.
It was Jesus, coming to my rescue, It was Jesus, coming to my rescue.
He said"Brotherhood and Unity and Fellowship of man, You stand together. You don't lean to the left, You don't lean to the right.
You must stand in the middle, You must stand in the middle." So come on, come on, come on then, Coming on, coming on, coming on, coming on strong
Come on, come on, come on then, Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, etc ... I heard him say,"What a wonderful day for a moondance
What a wonderful day for romance"I heard him say,"Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven's door"I heard him say,"Come on baby light my fire
Try to set the night on fire"I heard him say,"Non de rien de rien
Non je ne regrette rien"I heard him say he is coming
Coming from the third world
He is black, don't hold him back. Hallelujah Jesus come. He's coming to a table
Of United Nations -He's coming from the third world -Don't hold him back."What have you done
To all my children? Look what you've done
Just look what you've done -That I must come -Oh, I'm coming." So come on, come on, come on, Come on, come on, come on.
