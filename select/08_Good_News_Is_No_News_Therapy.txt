Everything it's a fucking drama
Don't you wanna a lil piece?
You tangle up on the same hell
Don't you wanna be release?

(Hook)
In your shoes, confuse is no use
In your shoes

You never use to be so bad
Now all your apathy it's gone
It's so pathetic desperate
Why can you chose to move on?

(Hook) x 2
In your shoes, confuse is no use
In your shoes

I'm sorry for your problem,
But I got trouble on my own
I try to review but it will never happen again

(Hook) x 3

In your shoes x 3
