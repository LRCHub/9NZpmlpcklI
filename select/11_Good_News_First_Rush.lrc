[00:50.16] The best we can agree on
[00:54.65] Is it could have been worse
[00:58.96] What happened to your old
[01:02.32] Benevolent universe?
[01:12.32] 
[01:07.85] You know the one with stars
[01:10.73] That revolve around you
[01:16.12] Beaming down full of promises
[01:20.25] To bring good news
[01:29.25] 
[01:25.40] You used to feel that way
[01:29.60] The saddest words you could ever say
[01:34.41] But I know you? ll remember that day
[01:39.82] And the most beautiful words I could ever say
[01:48.63] And the most beautiful words I could ever say
[02:11.13] 
[02:00.69] The worst thing about it all
[02:03.58] Is that you might have been right
[02:08.97] And I'm still not really sure
[02:12.45] What started that fight
[02:23.95] 
[02:17.81] And I still get this feeling
[02:22.03] There? s more trouble ahead
[02:26.74] So never mind the bad news
[02:29.96] Let's have the good news instead
[02:45.96] 
[02:35.50] You used to feel that way
[02:39.49] The saddest words you could ever say
[02:44.10] But I know you'll remember that day
[02:49.19] And the most beautiful words I could ever say
[02:58.56] And the most beautiful words
[03:12.56] 
[03:01.64] Some would say they never fear a thing
[03:05.69] Well, I do
[03:07.99] And I'm afraid enough for both of us
[03:13.93] For me and you
[03:20.93] 
[03:18.90] Time, if nothing else, will do its worst
[03:22.86] So do me that favor and tell me the good news first
[03:32.39] The good news first
[04:02.87] You used to feel that way
[04:06.59] The saddest words you could ever say
[04:11.44] But I know you'll remember that day
[04:16.80] And the most beautiful words I could ever say
[04:25.61] And the most beautiful words I could ever say
[04:34.89] To the most beautiful words I could ever say
